# baka admin konfiguration assistant
This is mostly just a wrapper around git along with some other commands to help with managing servers or home directories  
If you're looking for something similar but not stupid, see [etckeeper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Etckeeper) or other [alternatives](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dotfiles)  
Otherwise, you can install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bakabakabaka/) with `pip install bakabakabaka`
